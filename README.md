matchem-poker-qt
================

Arcade style match-n game with poker hands for Qt, WP and iOS devices.

Match'em Poker is a game originally written for iOS. This project aimed to port it to Symbian and !MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan with [http://projects.developer.nokia.com/qtgameenabler Qt GameEnabler]. The objective was to port the application with minimal effort: Reusing all of the original assets, modifying the code as little as possible, etc.
See the [wiki:porting_diary Porting Diary] for more information.
